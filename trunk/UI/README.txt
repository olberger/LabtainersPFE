CODE WRITTEN BY: Daniel Liao

PROGRAM/CODE STRUCTURE:

- The mainUI object has a 'lab' data object inside that stores the current state of the UI.
  - This 'lab' data object includes:
      - List of 'Container' data objects
      - List of 'Network' data objects
      - 'Results' Data object
      - 'Goals' Data object
  - When a user saves the lab the program writes whatever is in the 'lab' data object 
    to the lab files, namely start.config, results.config, and goals.config.
  - All Results UI/Data code are in their own package 
    and all Goals UI/Data code are in their own package
- Each Container/Network Panel Object has a Container/Network data object 
  that references the same Contaienr/Network data object in the data object 
  lists in the 'lab' data object.
     - So when you press confirm for each container/network configuration 
       dialog box, it changes the Container/Network data object in the 
       'lab' data object.

- The Results/Goals UI have their own results data object, NOT a reference pointing to
  the results/goals data object in the 'lab' data object. 
     - When initially opening the results/goals UI the results/goals data object here is 
       a copy from the main UI's 'lab' data. 
     - When the user presses confirm changes in the Goals/Results UI, it makes a deep copy
       of the current data state here and sets it to the results/goals data object in the
       'lab' data object.  

-Immediate changes to a lab's files and directories occur when the user: 
 - Deletes a container
 - Renames a container
 - Adds a container
 - Edit a container's dockerfile

- All other changes are written to the labs files when the user
  presses save lab/save lab as.


TODOS:

- RUN/BUILD Button
- Validation on User Input outside of Goals and Results UI
- Tooltips on all the fields
- LOGS Button (Pulls up terminal window that spits program output)
- Parameter Configuration Button/UI
- Menu Items
    - Help
    - Help/About
    - Help/Check For Updates
- UI Consistency in Goals UI and Results UI when a results artifact line is modified/deleted 
  and container is renamed/deleted/added, respectively


NOTES AND CONCERNS TO ADDRESS:

- The program as of now has a high potential for bugs, so
  it's imperative to do extensive testing for a series of 
  actions. 
  
  Ex. Having the Results UI opened and deleting a container 
  that an artifact line is referencing. Does the Results visual
  interface have continuity?   

- The project was 3 main functions from 3 seperate packages, 
  so the current build script may not work

- When user updates the LABTAINERS DIR path, what happens if the new set path is a 
  place where the currently opened lab does not exist. A bug can occur if the
  user opens a lab, saves/save as  a lab, renames a conainer, adds a container, 
  or deletes a container. (Essentially any part of the program that references the 
  lab path, since the lab path is relative to the LABTAINERS DIR)

- Parts of the UI that use a JPanel and JScrollPane, may make use of magic numbers when
  adding and removing subpanels from the JPanel to adjust for the exact needed height
  to fit all the subpanels visibly.  

UI DEVELOPER NOTE:
- To ensure you can build and run the netbeans project for the UI, follow these steps:
   Installing Netbeans:
      1) sudo apt-get update
      2) sudo snap install netbeans --classic
      3) bash
      
   Installing Java JDK 14 (from method 2 of https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-java-14-on-ubuntu-debian/)
      4) sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/java
      5) sudo apt -y install oracle-java14-installer
      6) sudo apt -y install oracle-java14-set-default
      7) sudo nano /etc/profile.d/jdk.sh
         a) Add "export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin"
      8) source /etc/profile.d/jdk.sh
      
   Opening Netbeans and Setting the environment
      9) netbeans
      In the netbeans program...
      10) open the netbeans project folder 'MainUI'
      11) install the plugins that pop up
      12) Right-click 'MainUI' in the 'Projects' tab and select 'Resolve Project Problems'
      13) Select Resolve
      14) If the Java Platform Manager pops up then select 'Add Platform'
      15) Make sure 'Java Standard Edition' is selected and press Next. 
      15) Find the folder '/usr/lib/jvm/java-14-oracle' 
      16) Press Next and then Finish
      17) Ensure that 'JDK 14' is selected (not 'JDK 14 (Default)') in the  Java Platform Manager, and press Close.
      18) Select the next Project Problem which should be "Some dependency artifacts are not in..." and press Resolve.
      19) Press Close when finished.
      20) Close netbeans and reopen it by entering 'netbeans' in the terminal
      21) Press the run button and when prompted for the main class select "labtainers.mainui.MainWindow" and enter.
    
    Now you should be all set to develop the labtainers UI
