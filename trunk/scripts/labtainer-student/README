This is the Labtainers workspace from which all student
labs are started using:

    labtainer <labname>

Leaving out the labname will result in display of a
list of labs.

Use
    stoplab <labname>

to stop a lab and collect its results.  Note, it is
good practice to stop labs before transitioning to
new labs or to instructor instances, otherwise there
may be networking name conflicts.

If you wish to restart a lab from scratch, wiping out
all previous data and work in the lab, use:

    labtainer <labname> -r
